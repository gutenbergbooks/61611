<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>The</i> WESTERN COWBOY</span></h2>
<p>Call him <i>bronco buster</i>, <i>cowpuncher</i>, <i>cattleman</i>, or
just plain <i>ranch hand</i> ... the western cowboy to
those who know him best, has always been &ldquo;just a plain,
everyday upstandin&rsquo; man!&rdquo; He is courageous and fearless ...
loyal to his outfit and to his friends, and does
his best to live up to the code of his colorful calling.</p>
<p>An oldtimer might tell you that the cowboy&rsquo;s code calls
for &ldquo;courage and loyalty, uncomplaining cheerfulness,
laughter at danger and hardships, lack of curiosity regarding
another&rsquo;s past, and respect for womanhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy may change with the times, but so long as
the West raises cattle he&rsquo;ll be with us ... riding the
range, testing his skill at the rodeo ... &ldquo;doin&rsquo; his job&rdquo;
as he upholds the proud traditions of the West and
one of its greatest industries ... the cattle business.</p>

<p>The cowboy and the horse he rides are the result
of a way of life. The man and the animal have
developed together, adapting themselves to a type
of life and work unfamiliar to millions of our
present generation.</p>
<p>The dime-novel, two-gun characters of fiction, the
movies built around these stories, and the occasional
rodeo performance, are the basis for the average person&rsquo;s impressions
about the Western cowboy. Overlooked are the real life and
the important daily tasks of these men on horseback who provide the
meat for the nation&rsquo;s tables.</p>
<p>The cowboy knows no hours. From sunup to sundown, in blizzard, rain
and sunshine, he watches and cares for his herd.</p>
<p>The pioneers who built the cattle business into a tremendous industry
used the saddle for making history. The modern cowboy following in
their path is still using a saddle for a throne from which he upholds a
tradition ... and never will he forsake that saddle for a jalopy to help
him over the rough places.</p>

<p>Probably no other American spends a greater part of his time outdoors
than the Western cowboy. Certainly no other form of activity is
so dependent upon the whims of Nature and animals. A calf may stray
among jagged rocks, and a horse break a leg in recovering him. Rider
and horse are always flirting with danger! Sickness in a herd or among
the horses calls for expert knowledge and kindness. Broken fences,
storms, mountain lions and the elements themselves present problems
which to many of us would seem insurmountable. Gopher holes lurk
in hidden places to throw both horse and rider; turbulent streams with
their slippery boulders must be forded; high ledges and snowy precipices
must be traversed under varying conditions.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a rugged life and one which calls for strong men with clear
eyes and steady hands. Under these men must be sturdy, sure-footed
horses.</p>
<p>This combination of man and horse has contributed greatly to the
romantic history of America; and, even today, typifies a way of life
unlike any other.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that this Western
life has developed a strange
and flavorful language of its
own ... distinctly different from
that used in other walks of life.
It&rsquo;s natural, too, that special
clothing should be worn. Above
all, it is essential that the cowboy&rsquo;s
greatest asset, the horse,
should be specially bred and
trained.</p>
<p>There are many of the words of
the trail and cow camp in these
pages. You&rsquo;ll become familiar with the type of clothing worn by the
Western cowboy. Most of all, you&rsquo;ll see and learn about the magnificent
horses that he rides. At work, at play and in the show ring ... the
horse is dominant!</p>

<h3 id="c2">FRIEND AND SERVANT</h3>
<p>A good cow horse must possess strength and intelligence, and be well
trained to use both. He has a natural instinct for sensing direction and
detecting danger, both by day and by night. He is game and brave and
will drop dead in the performance of his work, if need be. He is well
adapted to his place ... tough and inured to the hardships of his life.
His lightness of foot and quickness of motion fit him better for this
work than any other type of horse.</p>
<div class="img">

<p>He must have good feet, good

work. The cow horse soon learns
to know his rider as they work together,
and his good sense is his

<h3 id="c3">THE COWBOY&rsquo;S CLOTHES</h3>
<p>A generation ago the East knew the cowboy as a bloody demon of
disaster, reckless and rowdy, weighted down with &ldquo;six guns,&rdquo; wearing
a ten-gallon hat, bright silk shirt, woolly chaps and clanking spurs.
Today, except for his hat, high-heeled boots and spurs, you&rsquo;ll find few
cowboys in complete regalia except on show days at the rodeo.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the cowboy wears each garment &ldquo;a-purpose.&rdquo; <i>For example</i>:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l"><span class="ss">CHAPS</span> </td><td class="j">are worn primarily to protect his legs from high brush, cold wind and rain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="ss">SPURS</span> </td><td class="j">are not worn for ornament, neither are they worn to punish; the cowboy uses them as &ldquo;reminders&rdquo; to help him control his horse and urge it to quick action.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="ss">STETSON</span> </td><td class="j">the wide-brimmed, high-crowned hat is an earmark of the West, has &ldquo;six times a dozen&rdquo; everyday uses. It serves as shade, protection from the elements, a drinking cup for horse and rider, and when waved it&rsquo;s extremely handy to turn stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="ss">BOOTS</span> </td><td class="j">high-heeled boots are a mark of distinction, the sign of a riding man. The high heels keep his feet from slipping through the stirrups. The heels also serve as an aid on the ground, allowing the cowboy to dig in when he is throwing his rope or holding stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="ss">GUNS</span> </td><td class="j">the cowboy &ldquo;totes a gun&rdquo; only for protection against Nature&rsquo;s hazards to his work. The days of the &ldquo;two-gun man&rdquo; and the &ldquo;quick-draw artist&rdquo; have been relegated to the realm of the Wild West story and movie.</td></tr>

<h3 id="c4">A COWBOY&rsquo;S WORK IS ALSO HIS FUN</h3>
<p>The rodeo is purely and exclusively a cowboy&rsquo;s sport. In fact, it is a
popular sport which originated in America. At first it was simply a
demonstration of the cowboy&rsquo;s skill, usually performed before other
cowboys. Contesting naturally followed and, of course, such thrilling
exhibitions of skill and courage soon attracted more and more spectators.
Today, rodeos are national
and international events. Experts
in bronc riding, calf roping, steer
wrestling and bull riding often
pocket prize money amounting to
as much as $35,000 in a year.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" alt="Bucking bronco" width="237" height="250" />
</div>
<p>Now, regularly scheduled events,
staged by popular demand, rodeos
are attracting larger and larger
crowds. Be they big or small, a
thrilling performance is assured the
spectators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Bronc riding is one of the most exciting of rodeo events and is always
popular with the cowboy himself. A man who follows the hazardous
trade of horse-breaking as a steady business has to be good. He must
have courage, experience and unusual ability; a good one is hard to
find. The best cow hands can ride the &ldquo;snuffy&rdquo; ones, but won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Good bronc riders stay with their horses. When they feel themselves
going they do not throw away the reins, start relaxing and look for a
soft spot to land. With skill, muscle and grim determination they will
wage a desperate battle to stay aboard.</p>

<p class="pcap">A &ldquo;RARE&rdquo; OCCASION</p>
</div>
<p>More and more cow horses are being broken to ride by patience and
gentleness. Today&rsquo;s horse is rarely a wild mustang caught on the prairie
and broken by a &ldquo;buster.&rdquo;
Usually he is of special
breeding, intended to develop
him for his particular
type of work.</p>
<p>The bucking horse, seen in
rodeos, is trained to buck;
many of them such as
&ldquo;Midnight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Five
Minutes To Midnight&rdquo;
have become world-famous
for their skill at throwing
riders.</p>
<p>Usually bucking horses or
&ldquo;broncs&rdquo; are part of a
&ldquo;string&rdquo; provided for rodeo
use. Many of these
&ldquo;wild&rdquo; horses live to a ripe
old age and have many
peaceful years grazing in
lush pastures long after
their bucking days are
over.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c5">BULL DOGGING</h3>
<p>This breathtaking feat consists of a dive from a horse at full gallop
to the horns of a full-grown steer and throwing the animal by hand.
One of the most dangerous stunts in the rodeo business, it also requires
extraordinary strength and agility on the part of the cowboy. The bull
dogger must stop the animal and &ldquo;twist him down&rdquo; so that all four feet
are off the ground on the
side in which the head is
pointed. The record time
for this event is three and
two-fifths seconds.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="Cowboy and bull" width="222" height="200" />

<p>Bull dogging is purely an

<h3 id="c6">BAREBACK BRONC RIDING</h3>
<p>Actually, this is less dangerous than riding a bronc with a saddle, but
more difficult to stay aboard.</p>
<p>Balance is all-important, since the cowboy is without benefit of stirrups
or saddle and must depend upon his knees for controlling his position
on the horse. One hand holds the halter and the other must swing free,
never touching the horse.</p>
<p>Even the good bareback riders are often thrown, but the fall as a rule
is &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and results only in the cowboy being thoroughly jarred.</p>

<h3 id="c7">BULL RIDING</h3>
<p>This is an extreme test of balance and courage. Bull riders are usually
&ldquo;top hands&rdquo; and represent the cream of fancy riders. Brahma bulls are
ridden with only &ldquo;bull rigging,&rdquo; which consists of two ropes, one around
the flank and one serving as a cinch with a bell to irritate and infuriate
the animal. They are always unpredictable and hard to ride.</p>
<p>The Brahma bull&rsquo;s skin is very loose, like that of a dog, and the rider
must stay on by sheer balance. Oftentimes the bulls become mean and
dangerous unless distracted by a man in the arena. A so-called &ldquo;clown,&rdquo;
actually an expert at distracting the bulls, is a part of the rodeo performance,
and it is he who prevents the animals from turning on thrown
cowboys.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement at these events is the fact that Brahmas can
and do quite often leap an eight-foot fence.</p>

<p>Not all of a cowboy&rsquo;s life is rough,

There are long hours of pleasant sunshine

<p>Moving the cattle to new pastures often
brings long, leisurely rides beneath brilliant
sunshine, over sage-scented prairie
or along verdant trails amid the world&rsquo;s
most beautiful scenery. Large ranches
now operate with plenty of help and
many modern conveniences. Good food
is essential to a cowboy&rsquo;s health and happiness, and the wise rancher
provides plenty of it. Comradeship and loyalty are predominant characteristics
of ranch life, and few real cowboys would exchange it for
any other way of life.</p>

<p>The very existence of the cowboy revolves around his horse. Proudly

feel &ldquo;naked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ranch conversation is mostly of horses; horses do the work, provide the

sorrows. Thus the breeding of these intelligent animals is an ever-interesting,
never-ending process.</p>
<p>Most popular among stockmen and cowboys today is the &ldquo;quarter
horse&rdquo;; however, there is an increasing demand for horses of part
Arabian blood which are the result of the breeding of purebred Arabian
horses to the native stock. With only around 3500 living Arabs today,
it is a lucky cowboy who gets to own or ride one. The Arabian blood
brings to the cattle pony the spirit, the sturdiness, the courage and,
above all, the great intelligence of the Arab, combined with the &ldquo;stockiness&rdquo;
of the range animal ... priceless ingredients in the making of a
fine cow horse. You&rsquo;ll be particularly interested in the world-famous

</div>
<p>From the hot desert sands of Arabia, the purebred Arab horse has
brought us all of his beauty, affection, strength and glory. For over
4,000 years the Arab steed served the desert Bedouins in peace and war,
ofttimes meaning the difference between life and death for his master.
He lived in the tent of his owner, as a member of the family. In his
noble heart this developed an affection unsurpassed.</p>
<p>Pasture land and water are very scarce in the desert country, but the
Arab horse does not require the food and water of an ordinary horse&mdash;because
of his small stomach. This was invaluable to the Bedouin, who
then could travel for days on a fiery charger without sighting pasture
or a water hole. Thus, the Arab has become known to us as &ldquo;Drinker
of the Wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although from this courageous lineage have descended all light breeds
of horses known to the world today&mdash;the Thoroughbred, Standard Bred,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
American Saddle Horse, Morgan, and so on down the line ... still we
cannot tell you the origin of the purebred Arab. That belongs to the
dim and distant past. God gave him to us and is preserving this precious
blood through the generous hearts of a handful of large breeders, mostly
located in the United States.</p>
<p>Why the United States? Because, with the advent of the automobile in
Arabia, the Bedouins learned they could travel faster and farther in
&ldquo;war cars&rdquo; than by Arabian horses; so they discontinued the use of
horses in warfare. This resulted in diminishing the breeding of pure
Arabians in the desert. Then, during World War II, many of the large
European Studs, which had been established from desert horses, were
completely demolished.</p>
<p>To give you a word picture of the purebred Arab, the United States
Department of Agriculture, in its bulletin, &ldquo;Breeds of Light Horses,&rdquo;
has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A typical Arabian horse has a wedge-shaped head; small nose; dish face; wide,
deep jaws; eyes set low, wide apart, and near the middle of the head; a relatively
large brain capacity; one less lumbar vertebra than most other horses, giving a short
weight-carrying back; one or two less vertebrae in the tail, which is set up on a high
croup and gaily carried; ribs spring wide and deep; large knee, hock, tendon and
hoof; dense bone; small stomach capacity, with small feed requirements and the
ability to assimilate rough feed; and a marked prepotency in the Stud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generally the Arabian horse in action
shows only the walk, trot, and canter.
The usual height is from 14 to 15.1
hands, and the weight from 850 to 1,100
pounds. Bay, gray and chestnut are the
predominating colors, with an occasional
white or black. White marks on the
head and legs are common, but purebred
Arabians are never piebald or spotted,
notwithstanding an erroneous impression
created by circus horses that are
commonly called Arabians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The love for the purebred Arab horse is so great that there are hundreds
of Arab owners, but only a few large breeders. Among these few
large breeders is The Van Vleet Arabian Stud, owned and operated by
The Trinidad Bean &amp; Elevator Company. Started by L.W. Van Vleet,
President of the company, it is located on The Lazy VV Ranch near
Nederland, Colorado. This ranch is now the mountain home of over
90 purebred Arabians.</p>
<p>The Lazy VV Ranch lies at an altitude of 8,500 to 13,000 feet, in the
heart of the Colorado Rockies. This Arabian Stud was started with a
foundation herd of about 30 head. Today it is the largest stud in our
country, excepting the Remount Depot at Pomona, California, owned
by the government. Trinidad, alone, has probably done as much toward
proving the merits of the Arabian as anyone else in this country.</p>
<p>One of the main purposes of this venture was to prove that the Arabian
horse could adjust himself to any climate and adapt himself to any use,
without injurious effects. So, to the Continental Divide, from the hot
sands of Arabia, the Arab horse has ascended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Living and working at that high altitude, the Arab is developing
greater wind and lung capacity, harder muscle, denser bone. Plenty of
pure mountain water and native hay are his sustenance. In return, he
gives much! Mares and colts receive no unusual care; are often exposed
to freezing temperatures and trying conditions which require remarkable
stamina.</p>
<p>Many Arab stallions can do twice the work of native stock horses
... with no signs of fatigue, poor legs, or other bad conditions which
will develop in cold-blooded horses. The Arab is less susceptible to
equine diseases than other breeds, and requires nothing in the way
of pampering.</p>
<p>To know an Arab is to love him ... to love him is to want him. He is
a rare and priceless possession.</p>

The Lazy VV Ranch and holds a
major position in the Stud&rsquo;s extensive
breeding program.</p>
<p>Unlike his desert ancestors, he is never left at home base when there is
active work to be done. Bedouins&rsquo; stallions were used for breeding but
not in warfare. A stallion, being much noisier than a mare, would be
apt to disclose the approach to an enemy tribe.</p>
<p>A list of <span class="smaller">ZARIFE&rsquo;S</span> colts is as long as your arm. He is represented by his

<p>During each week, the stallions you have seen on the foregoing pages

<p><span class="smaller">KAHAR&rsquo;S</span> beauty is readily detected in the colts he sires. For the most
part, those colts are out of daughters of <span class="smaller">RIFAGE</span>, which are grand-daughters
of <span class="smaller">ZARIFE</span>.</p>

<p>Because of the scarcity of water in Arabia, the Arab horse who spoiled
it was punished, of necessity. This respect for water has been so deeply
bred into the Arab that it takes a bit of training to change him.</p>
<p>Though small rations of water were the fate of desert Arabs, on The
Lazy VV Ranch a horse can bathe in it&mdash;as shown by <span class="smaller">KABAR</span>, who
unhesitatingly trails a cow and two calves through a belly-deep stream.</p>
<p><span class="smaller">KABAR</span> is typical of the horse desired by ranchers and stockmen. He is
what is known as the &ldquo;strong type&rdquo; Arab. The other two types are the
&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; and the &ldquo;racing.&rdquo; <span class="smaller">ZARIFE</span>, <span class="smaller">RIFAGE</span> and <span class="smaller">KAHAR</span> belong in the
&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; classification. The only &ldquo;racing&rdquo; type stallion raised on The
Lazy VV Ranch was <span class="smaller">BAREK</span>, who is making his home with the Mexican
Government in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Most of the stud colts sired by <span class="smaller">KABAR</span> have been sold to individual
ranchers, who are using them to produce better stock horses.</p>

</div>
<p>The life of an Arab mare on The Lazy VV Ranch differs greatly
from her desert sisters&rsquo; existence. In the desert, a mare carried her master
in tribal warfare, while the stallions stayed at home.</p>
<p>Any mare without a colt at her side is assigned the task of taking Lazy
VV Ranch riders over the high, rocky mountain trails. Brood mares
are left in the lush pastures to frolic and play with their colts. However,
not even the brood mares are coddled; they live and graze in the rugged
outdoors, year-round. Lazy VV Arabs must learn to care for themselves.</p>
<p>At the age of one year, these Arabs are halter broken; at two, they are
trained on the longe line, and some are driven; at three, they are trained
under saddle. Mares of sufficient size are bred at the age of three, and
every year thereafter.</p>

<p>From the day it is born, a Lazy

love and affection. The horse
trainers have often said it is a

Arab, because he is so used
to arms encircling his neck.</p>
<p>Everyone is encouraged to play

<p class="pcap">SUNDAY SHOW</p>
</div>
<p>Soon after Trinidad established its pure Arab Stud on The Lazy VV
Ranch, numerous people would stop by the Ranch with the hope they
could &ldquo;just look at those Arabian horses.&rdquo; These callers interrupted
the routine ranch work to such a degree that the decision was reached
to set aside Sunday morning, at which time the public might see the
Arabs in various phases of action.</p>
<p>These Sunday morning crowds outgrew the three stands which were
originally built to accommodate 150 spectators. The remaining hundreds
willingly stand around the railing from 9:45 until 11:30 A.M.,
to view these gorgeous creatures going through their paces. This opportunity
is only provided during the three months of summer&mdash;mid-June
through August.</p>
<p>Crowds prove the education is worth the discomfort. There is probably
no place in this country where a person can see so many Arabs, or learn
more about them during a two-hour period than by listening to the
announced comments and other information which is given as the Arabs
are shown.</p>
<p>It is truly a colorful spectacle to see 1,500 people from all walks of life,
dressed in varied attire, so intent and interested as they encircle the Arab
horse show ring at The Lazy VV.</p>

<p>Though authentic in cut,
these Bedouin robes are not authentic
in color. Bright greens,
reds, blues and gold add a sparkle
to the Sunday showing of
the Arabs, while the Bedouins
would be donning drab gray or
brown colors.</p>
<p>Lazy VV Arabs are not
groomed and put up in stalls a
day or so before the Sunday
crowds see them. These are the
same horses that work the cattle,
make the various trips over
rough mountain trails, or romp
and play in pastures during the
week.</p>
